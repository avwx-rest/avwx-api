# AVWX

The AVWX REST API is a publically-available, open-source REST API for aviation weather.

## Authentication

AVWX uses bearer tokens for user authentication. Create an account at [account.avwx.rest](https://account.avwx.rest) to generate your token and include it in your requests.

The API looks for tokens in two places:

- `"Authorization"` header. The token value can have any prefix (`"TOKEN abcde"`, `"BEARER abcde"`, etc) or just the token value itself
- `"?token=abcde"` URL parameter

The header value will supercede the URL parameter if both are found. All examples in the documentation use the header method.

Some features require paid plans to be associated with the supplied token. Feature availability is listed on the [Account Page](https://account.avwx.rest).

## Airport Codes

Airports and reporting stations can have four possible identifying codes assigned to them:

- ICAO: 4-letter code assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization
- IATA: 3-letter code assigned by the International Air Transport Association
- GPS: 4-letter code used for in-flight GPS navigation
- Local: The 3 or 4-letter code by the regional governing authority

AVWX matches the airport to your supplied station code by: ICAO, IATA, then GPS. The local code is information only.

Most airports do not have an official ICAO or IATA code. If they do, it should always match the GPS code. Additionally, most stations have a GPS code, but not all. For example, weather buoys have an ICAO but no GPS.

## Flight Path Routing

This API can return results based on a given flight route. These points can be:

- ICAO station idents: KJFK, EGLL, PHNL
- IATA airport idents: MIA, LGA, HNL
- Navaids like VOR and NDB: ATL, ORL, PQ
- Lat,Lon coordinates: 30.35,-81.013

The flight path combines these elements with semicolons to look like:

`KLEX;ATL;30.2,-82.1;ORL;KMCO`

This path starts at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, KY, down to the Atlanta VOR, a coordinate near Jacksonville, FL, the Orlando VOR, and ends at Orlando International Airport.

Unlike ICAO idents, navaid idents are not globally unique. AVWX determines the most likely coordinate pair based on the next known coordinate. If the final coordinate is still multiple choice, it will pick the two nearest ones and start backfilling. It is highly recommended to bookend each flight path with either ICAO idents or coordinate pairs, but VOR to VOR navigation will still work.

Because there are many overlaps between navaid and IATA codes and the navaids are more useful for flight routing purposes, IATA codes are deprioritized when calculating the flight path. It's recommended to use the airport's ICAO, GPS, or coordinate values if known.

Each routing response will include the resolved coordinates used for determining the flight path.

## aviowiki Airport Data

AVWX has partnered with [aviowiki](https://www.aviowiki.com) to provide a reliable, constantly verified source of airport informaion. If you've added the [aviowiki addon](https://account.avwx.rest/plans) to your account, you'll instantly start receiving this new vetted data. This will replace the open source - but sometimes out-of-date - information compiled from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com) and other locations. If you are using AVWX for mission-critical applications, it is highly reccomended that you enable this addon.

The served data includes general airport information and all landing surfaces including runways, helipads, etc. For more information, check out [aviowiki's API Docs](https://www.aviowiki.com/docs/airports/authenticated-api-endpoints/airport-data/). Additional fields can be requested by contacting us.

## Station Search [/search/station{?text,n,airport,reporting,format,remove,filter}]

Text search for stations by ICAO, IATA, name, city, and state. By default, these are only reporting stations, but this can be disabled to return smaller airports with non-reporting AWOS/ASOS as well.

+ Parameters
    + text: `lihue%20hi` (string) - Search text
    + n: 2 (number, optional) - Max results to return. Smaller numbers are more likely to not reach max
        + Default: 10
    + airport (boolean, optional) - Only include airports
        + Default: true
    + reporting (boolean, optional) - Only include reporting stations
        + Default: true
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`

## METAR [/metar/{location}{?options,airport,reporting,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

METAR reports are surface observations for a particular airfield or other station location. There are two standard formats: International and North American. The parser works with both, but it is up to the developer to do the correct interpretation of the data. Use the 'Units' key for labling and conversions.

Field notes:

- Relative humidity is a percentage coded as 0 to 1
- Pressure and density altitude of the airport are always returned in feet to match with cloud layers. You may want to convert into meters when displaying to your users

+ Parameters
    + location: `KJFK` (string) - ICAO & IATA station code or coordinate pair
        + Examples: `EGLL`, `51.47,-0.4`
    + options (string, optional) - Additional options to include as comma-separated string
        + Supported: `info`, `translate`, `summary`, `speech`
        + Example: `info,speech`
    + airport (boolean, optional) - Only include airports when performing a coordinate search
        + Default: true
    + reporting (boolean, optional) - Only include reporting stations when performing a coordinate search
        + Default: true
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`
    + onfail (string, optional) - Error, use out-of-date cache, or check nearest station when unable to fetch report
        + Supported: `cache`, `error`, `nearest`
        + Default: `cache`

### Get METAR Report [GET]

Get the METAR for a specific station by ICAO & IATA station code or a lat,lon coordinate pair. The API will return the station nearest to those coordinates. Include `info` in the options to get details about the selected station.

        + Supported: `info`, `translate`, `summary`, `speech`
        + Example: `info,speech`
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`

### Parse a Given METAR [POST]

Parse a user-supplied METAR included as the plain text body of the request. Note that the parsed timestamp may differ from the actual release date of the given report depending on how old the report is. AVWX does it's best to provide a full timestamp even though METARs don't include the year and month.

## TAF [/taf/{location}{?options,airport,reporting,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

TAF reports are atmospheric conditions for an area within five nautical miles of a particular airfield or other station location. Unlike METAR which only has two standard formats, TAF reports vary considderably more based on their geography. For example, Oceania TAF reports include two unique keys: Temp-List and Alt-List.

+ Parameters
    + location: `KJFK` (string) - ICAO & IATA station code or coordinate pair
        + Examples: `EGLL`, `51.47,-0.4`
    + options: `summary` (string, optional) - Additional options to include as comma-separated string
        + Supported: `info`, `translate`, `summary`, `speech`
        + Example: `info,speech`
    + airport (boolean, optional) - Only include airports when performing a coordinate search
        + Default: true
    + reporting (boolean, optional) - Only include reporting stations when performing a coordinate search
        + Default: true
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`
    + onfail (string, optional) - Error, use out-of-date cache, or check nearest station when unable to fetch report
        + Supported: `cache`, `error`, `nearest`
        + Default: `cache`

### Get TAF Report [GET]

Get the TAF for a specific station by ICAO & IATA station code or a lat,lon coordinate pair. The API will return the station nearest to those coordinates. Include `info` in the options to get details about the selected station.

## PIREP [/pirep/{location}{?options,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

A PIREP (Pilot Report) is an observation made by pilots inflight meant to aid controllers and pilots routing around adverse conditions and other conditions of note. They typically contain icing, turbulance, cloud types/bases/tops, and other info at a known distance and radial from a ground station. They are released as they come in.

## AIR / SIGMET [/airsigmet{?format,remove,filter,onfail}]

A SIGMET (Significant Meteorological Information) is a weather advisory for the safety of all aircraft. They are divided into:

- Convective - thunderstorms, hail, and cyclones
- Non-Convective - turbulence, icing, dust clouds, volcanic activity, and radiation

An AIRMET (Airman's Meteorological Information) is a weather advisory for smaller aircraft or VFR navigation. They are divided into:

- Sierra - IFR conditions like low ceilings and mountain obscuration
- Tango - turbulance and high surface winds
- Zulu - icing and freezing levels

Both types share a similar report format and therefore are combined into a single list. The bulletin and weather type can be used to classify each as a SIGMET or AIRMET for filtering purposes.

Filtering options are available for:

- Point searches (see AIR SIG Contains)
- Flight path intersects (see Report Routing)

+ Parameters
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`
    + onfail (string, optional) - Error or use out-of-date cache when unable to fetch report
        + Supported: `cache`, `error`
        + Default: `cache`

## NOTAM [/notam/{location}{?distance,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

Get NOTAM reports detailing special events or conditions affecting airport and flight operations. These can include, but are in no way limitted to:

- Runway closures
- Lack of radar services
- Rocket launches
- Hazard locations
- Airspace restrictions
- Construction updates
- Unusual aircraft activity

NOTAMs have varius classifications and apply to certain types or size of aircraft. Some apply only to IFR operations, like when an ILS is out of service. Others apply only to airport operations the en route aircraft can ignore.

Every NOTAM has a start and end date and time. Additional NOTAMs may be issued to update, replace, or cancel existing NOTAMs as well. Some NOTAMs may still be served up to 10 days after the end date, so it's up to the developer to include or filter these reports.

+ Parameters
    + location: `KMCO` (string) - ICAO & IATA station code or coordinate pair
        + Examples: `EGLL`, `51.47,-0.4`
    + distance (number,optional) - Distance in statue miles from airport or coordinate center
        + Default: `10`
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`

### Get NOTAM Reports [GET]

Get NOTAMs the apply to a specific airport or within a specified distance of a coordinate.

## NBM [/nbm/{report}/{location}{?options,airport,reporting,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

The [National Blend of Models](https://www.weather.gov/mdl/nbm_home) is a weather forecast model for North America provided by NOAA. AVWX currently supports these forecast types that pertain to atmospheric conditions:

- [NBH](https://www.weather.gov/mdl/nbm_textcard_v32#nbh) - Hourly forecast for the next 25 hours
- [NBS](https://www.weather.gov/mdl/nbm_textcard_v32#nbs) - Short-term forecast from 6 to 72 hours with 3-hour time intervals starting at 00
- [NBE](https://www.weather.gov/mdl/nbm_textcard_v32#nbe) - Extended forecast from 24 to 192 hours with 12-hours time intervals at 00 and 12

While these reports officially support ICAO stations in the United States and Puerto Rico, Guam, and US Virgin Islands, some other stations in North America will also work. It is recommended to request reports by ICAO station ID, but coordinate searches are accepted as well.

+ Parameters
    + report: `nbs` (string) - NBM report type
        + Supported: `nbh`, `nbs`, `nbe`
    + location: `KJFK` (string) - ICAO & IATA station code or coordinate pair
        + Examples: `EGLL`, `51.47,-0.4`
    + options: (string, optional) - Additional options to include as comma-separated string

## GFS [/gfs/{report}/{location}{?options,airport,reporting,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

The [Global Forecast System](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs) is a weather forecast model provided by NOAA. AVWX currently supports these forecast types that pertain to atmospheric conditions:

- [MOS MAV](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/synop/mavcard.php) - Atmospheric forecast from 6 to 72 hours in advance updated every 6 hours
- [MOS MEX](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/synop/mexcard.php) - Extended MAV forecast from 12 to 192 hours in advance updated every 12 hours

While these reports officially support ICAO stations in the United States and Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands, some other stations in North America will also work. It is recommended to request reports by ICAO station ID, but coordinate searches are accepted as well.

NOAA is retiring all GFS reports over the next few years and recommends everyone migrate to NBM. AVWX will support these GFS endpoints until NOAA retires the service, but it is highly recommended to use the NBM endpoints if you don't need GFS products specifically.

+ Parameters
    + report: `mav` (string) - GFS report type
        + Supported: `mav`, `mex`
    + location: `KJFK` (string) - ICAO & IATA station code or coordinate pair
        + Examples: `EGLL`, `51.47,-0.4`
    + options: (string, optional) - Additional options to include as comma-separated string
        + Supported: `info`
    + airport (boolean, optional) - Only include airports when performing a coordinate search
        + Default: true
    + reporting (boolean, optional) - Only include reporting stations when performing a coordinate search
        + Default: true
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`
    + onfail (string, optional) - Error or use out-of-date cache when unable to fetch report
        + Supported: `cache`, `error`
        + Default: `cache`

### Get GFS MAV Report [GET]

Get the GFS MAV report for a specific station by ICAO & IATA station code or a lat,lon coordinate pair. The API will return the station nearest to those coordinates. Include `info` in the options to get details about the selected station.

Note: The forecast list is truncated to the first few time periods.

## Report Search [/search/{report_type}{?text,n,options,airport,reporting,format,remove,filter,onfail}]

Returns weather reports by searching for stations by ICAO, IATA, name, city, and state. By default, these are only reporting stations, but this can be disabled to return smaller airports with non-reporting AWOS/ASOS as well. This endpoint is limited to paid plans, and the `n` parameter is limitted to 10 while enterprise plans can go up to 200.

+ Parameters
    + report_type: `metar` (string) - Weather report type
        + Supported: `metar`, `taf`
    + text: `lihue%20hi` (string) - Search text
    + n: 2 (number, optional) - Max results to return. Smaller numbers are more likely to not reach max
        + Default: 10
    + options (string, optional) - Additional options to include as comma-separated string
        + Supported: `info`, `translate`, `summary`, `speech`
        + Example: `info,speech`
    + airport (boolean, optional) - Only include airports
        + Default: true
    + reporting (boolean, optional) - Only include reporting stations
        + Default: true
    + format (string, optional) - Desired response format
        + Supported: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`
        + Default: `json`
    + remove (string, optional) - Remove unused keys from the response
        + Examples: `spoken,repr`, `runways`
    + filter (string, optional) - Only include these keys in the response
        + Examples: `sanitized`, `flight_rules,altimeter,value`
    + onfail (string, optional) - Error, use out-of-date cache, or check nearest station when unable to fetch report
        + Supported: `cache`, `error`, `nearest`
        + Default: `cache`

## Report Routing [/path/{report_type}{?route,distance,options,format,remove,filter}]

Find weather reports along a flight path. See notes on routing above.

Note: NOTAM routing is limited to ICAO and IATA codes due to data source limitations. If there is enough interest, the other markers could be added by resolving to the nearest airport per point in the path.

+ Parameters
    + report_type: `metar` (string) - Weather report type
        + Supported: `metar`, `taf`, `airsigmet`, `notam`
    + route: `KMCO;ORL;KDAB` (string) - Flight route with ICAO, navaid, and coordinate components
    + distance (number, optional) - Distance in statue miles from airport or coordinate center. Does not apply to `airsigmet`
        + Default: 5
    + options (string, optional) - Additional options to include as comma-separated string
        + Supported: `info`, `translate`, `summary`, `speech`
